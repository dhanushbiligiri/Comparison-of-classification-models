# Comparison-of-classification-models
Project overview: The objective of this project is to evaluate various feature selection strategies and spam
email classification systems. We want to look into how well feature selection methods like
PCA, Recursive Feature Elimination performs and Chi Squared test. We also want to look into how well various
classification methods like Naive Bayes, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Decision Trees, K-nearest
neighbors, and Support Vector Machines perform. The goal is to identify the feature
selection and classification technique combination that produces the most accurate
classification of spam.

Data Resources:
We are interested in using is the SMSSpamCollection dataset
which is a publicly available dataset for spam classification, which can be found on
the UCI Machine Learning Repository or Kaggle. The dataset contains a collection of
SMS messages that are labeled as either "ham" or "spam". It consists of 5,572 SMS
messages in total, with 4,827 messages labeled as "ham" and 747 messages labeled
as "spam".
